# Welcome to My Blog!

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates the markdown-based blogging system. Each blog post lives in its own date-based folder, making it easy to organize content and associated media.

## Adding Images

You can add images to your blog posts by placing them in the same folder as your markdown file. For example:

```markdown
![Blog Image](./image.jpg)
```

## Code Snippets

You can include code snippets with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
    title: string;
    date: Date;
    content: string;
}
```

## Organization

Blog posts can be organized with:
- Related images and media files
- Clean, dated archive structure
- Easy-to-manage content

## Formatting

You can use all standard markdown formatting:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Lists (like this one)
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And more!
